v1.0 – Baseline implementation of the Payments API + OpenAPI spec + Specmatic contract testing.
v2.0 (planned) – Extend with an Agentic AI developer assistant (using Claude/Ollama + LangChain4j + RAG) to auto-generate code and tests following our tech stack and design patterns.



v1.0

Features:

- Spring Boot REST API (/payments):
- POST /payments → create a payment (returns 201 or 400)
- GET /payments/{id} → fetch a payment (returns 200 or 404)
- Contract-first testing with Specmatic:
- API behavior is verified against the OpenAPI contract (simple-payments.yaml)
- Validates both happy-path and error scenarios
- qError handling aligned with contract (ErrorResponse {code, message})



To run -> ./mvnw -Dtest=ContractTests test

v2.0 – Planned Roadmap

Goal

Introduce an Agentic AI assistant to support developers in building and testing new APIs faster, while ensuring adherence to our tech stack and design patterns.

Planned Enhancements

- AI-powered code generation:
= Integrate Claude Code (via Ollama or Anthropic API) + LangChain4j to generate Java Spring Boot code for new endpoints.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
- Provide the AI with contextual knowledge (coding standards, OpenAPI specs, design patterns, domain rules).
- MCP (Model Context Protocol):
- Expose safe tools to the model:

Run Specmatic stubs/tests

- Execute mvn test
- Apply code scaffolding
- Payments domain focus:
    -Generate production-grade code following:
    -Spring Boot + REST
- Microservices architecture
- Domain patterns for payments (idempotency, error codes, status handling)

Example AI Agent Flow

- Developer provides a new OpenAPI spec for, say, Refunds API.
- Agent uses RAG + LangChain4j to scaffold controller, service, DTOs.
-  Agent triggers Specmatic tests via MCP.
- If tests fail, agent suggests/fixes code until contract is green.
- Final output is production-ready, spec-compliant code.
