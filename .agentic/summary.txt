It looks like you're experiencing a series of test failures in your API testing suite. Based on the output, it appears that there are two main issues:

1. **Incorrect HTTP status codes**:
	* In multiple tests (contractTest() methods), the expected HTTP status code is 201, but the actual response has a status code of 400.
	* Another test expects a status code of 200 for a GET request to retrieve a payment by ID, but receives a 404 status code instead.
2. **Repetition**:
	* There are multiple occurrences of the same tests failing with the same expected/actual status codes.

To troubleshoot these issues, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Review API documentation and implementation**:
	* Double-check that your API endpoints and methods return the correct HTTP status codes as per their specifications.
	* Verify that any data retrieval or processing logic is working correctly.
2. **Check test setup and configuration**:
	* Review how you're setting up your tests, including the creation of payment records and IDs used in GET requests.
	* Ensure that test data is being populated correctly and consistently.
3. **Investigate the root cause of the issues**:
	* Look for any patterns or common factors among the failing tests.
	* Use debugging tools (e.g., print statements, logging) to gain insights into what's happening during each failed test.
4. **Update your testing framework and configuration**:
	* Make sure that you're using the latest version of your testing library and frameworks.
	* Verify that all dependencies are properly configured.

Once you've addressed these potential issues, re-run your tests and verify that they pass as expected.
