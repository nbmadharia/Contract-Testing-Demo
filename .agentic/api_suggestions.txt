It seems like you're experiencing issues with your API testing using a tool like Specmatic or a similar framework. The errors indicate that the API is not behaving as expected:

1. For the "Create a payment" endpoint (POST /payments), it should return a status code of 201 Created, but instead, it's returning a 400 Bad Request.
2. For the "Get a payment by ID" endpoint (GET /payments/{id}), it should return a status code of 200 OK when a valid payment ID is provided, but it's returning a 404 Not Found.

These errors suggest that there might be issues with how your API handles incoming requests, particularly regarding validation and resource existence:

1. For the "Create a payment" endpoint:
   - Check if all required fields are being correctly validated.
   - Ensure that the input data is in the correct format as defined in your API schema.

2. For the "Get a payment by ID" endpoint:
   - Verify that your application can properly locate and retrieve a payment using a given ID.
   - Make sure that there's a mechanism to handle cases where no payment with the specified ID exists, returning an appropriate error response (404 Not Found in this case).

To resolve these issues:

- Review your API implementation for any logic errors or missing validations.
- Ensure your test cases cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, to help identify areas that need improvement.
- If using a framework like Specmatic, consult the documentation for guidance on how to properly configure and execute tests against your API.

Remember to update your API code based on the findings and rerun your tests to validate whether the issues have been resolved.
