The test results indicate that there are issues with the implementation of the payment API endpoints. Specifically, the `POST /payments` endpoint is not functioning as expected and is returning a 400 status code instead of the expected 201 status code. Additionally, the `GET /payments/(id:string)` endpoint is returning a 404 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

To resolve these issues, you should review the implementation of the payment API endpoints and ensure that they are correctly handling the requests and responses as specified in the API contract. This may involve fixing bugs or errors in the code, ensuring that all required fields are being validated and processed correctly, and verifying that the response data is being formatted correctly according to the API specification.

Once you have made the necessary changes to the implementation, you should re-run the tests to ensure that the issues have been resolved. If there are any further issues, you may need to repeat this process until all tests pass successfully.
