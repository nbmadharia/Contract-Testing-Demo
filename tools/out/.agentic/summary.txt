Here is the summary of Specmatic/JUnit failures by endpoint and cause:

**Failures Summary**

| Endpoint | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| POST /payments | (a) API behavior bug: Expected status 201, but got status 400 |

There are 13 failures reported for the `contractTest()` method in the `ContractTests` suite. All of them fail with the same expected and actual values:

* Expected response status code: 201
* Actual response status code: 400

This suggests that there is a bug in the API behavior, causing it to return an HTTP error (status code 400) instead of the expected success response (status code 201).

**Actionable List**

1. Investigate the API behavior for the `POST /payments` endpoint.
2. Check if the API's business logic or validation rules are incorrect, causing the status code to be returned as 400.
3. Update the API behavior accordingly to return a successful response (status code 201) when a payment is created successfully.

Note: The other possible causes (wrong OpenAPI spec, Specmatic config, test data) do not seem to be relevant in this case, based on the provided information.
