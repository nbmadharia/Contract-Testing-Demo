Here is a minimal config edit (in YAML) that should fix the issues:

```yaml
version: 2
contracts:
  - provides:
      - src/main/resources/openapi/payments.yaml
specmatic:
  unified-diff:
    include-line-numbers: true
```

This will enable the production of unified diffs with exact line numbers and will also include the `@@` hunk markers. 

If you're still facing issues, it's possible that the problem is not with the config but rather with the actual test results. In this case, let me know and I can help you with debugging.
